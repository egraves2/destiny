## Destiny 2 Companion App (React JS)

This class project was completed for HCDE 438 Web Technologies. 
My goal was to build an applica6on that connects to the game Destiny 2 using the Bungie.net API. The app was initially planned tobe able to create custom loadouts for players’ characters. This means that a user will be able to sign in to their Steam, Xbox, or Playsta6on Bungie account, view the current weapons and armor on their characters, and customize the characters’ loadouts in realtime.  

Currently, Destiny 2 does not support character loadouts. A “loadout” refers to a set of weapons and armor that can be changed all at once. The current interface requires the user to individually swap out each item. Having a loadout system would save time, as different activities need different types of armor and weapons. Therefore, I think all Destiny players would benefit from this app. I planned to make the UI simple and intuitive so this action can be completed quickly.

## Reflection

This idea turned out to be much more challenging than I thought it would, but I learned a ton through the process. By the end of the project, I feel MUCH more comfortable with HTML and CSS. I learned how to efficiently use the Inspect tool to perfect the nitty-gritty details. I also now have a better understanding of React terminology and how to write GET/POST requests. Some areas I struggled with were navigating the API documentation and avoiding redundant code. The Bungie.net API lacked many guides, particularly for React. I had to do a ton of "googling" throughout this project to understand things such as CORS. I think my code isn't nearly as concise as it could be. For the sake of time, my code has some redundancy so I think I could have shortened parts of my code with additional functions.

My final product does not meet its initial goal, but I'm still proud of what I completed. My equipItem POST method was not working so I instead created detailed tooltips for all the inventory items. Hovering over an item displays its name, type, description, picture, and power level. My app is also responsive! If I was to work on it more, I would keep working towards my goal of being able to create character loadouts. I would also allow users to manage multiple characters instead of one. Linked is a video demo of the website since you need a Destiny account to use it.
